Python Space Adventure
Games:
	Asteroid Dodging Game (Mercury)  - Andrew Vo
	Simon Memory Game (Venus) - Stephen Daloisio
	Space Quiz (Earth) - Eric Wan
	Minesweeper Game (Mars) - Anthony Knesis
	Alien Shooting Game (Jupiter) - Anthony Romano

Notes:
1. Install pygame. It will be necessary for the Asteroid dodging game and the Simon memory game.
2. The main file is python_final_menu.py. Use it to create/load profiles, start the game, etc.
3. Some features may not work depending on operating system. 
   For example, if fonts do not work due to OS problems, replace all references to 'ar destine' and 'ocr a std' with 'arial'. Note, this may affect sizing issues.
4. Enjoy!
